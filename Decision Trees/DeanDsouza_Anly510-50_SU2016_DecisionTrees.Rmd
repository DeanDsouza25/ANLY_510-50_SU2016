```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Soltuions:

* First, build a decision tree using Rattle just as we did here on a data set of your choosing.  
  + Take several screen shots of your work and paste into a MS Word, LibreOffice, of pdf file, explain each step
  + Tell me what you learned from the decision tree  

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
```

* Build another model of your choice using Rattle on the same data set  
  + You can run Association Analysis, PCA, Regression, .whatever
  + Tell me what you learned from this analysis and from the decision tree combined


```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
```

* Tell me why you prefer RStudio over Rattle or the opposite or some other tool of your choice over Rstudio.  Just looking for opinions here, but I am curious HOW you evaluate the different tools.
